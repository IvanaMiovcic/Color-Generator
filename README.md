# Color-Generator
A simple JavaScript web page that generates a random color when the user presses the button. Details about the color are then displayed so that if the user likes the random color, they can use it in their projects. This was my first JavaScript project and was created as a fun way to learn Javascript.

To view the project, <a href="#"> click here </a>.
